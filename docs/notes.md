## RL + ART + RULER notes

### 1. **Verifiable Domains**
Problems where success can be objectively measured programmatically.

**Examples:**
- Games (2048, Chess, Go) - clear win/loss
- Math problems - check if answer matches ground truth
- Coding - run tests, check if code executes correctly
- Formal systems - compilers, type checkers

**Reward Assignment:** Deterministic function
```python
trajectory.reward = calculate_score(outcome)  # No LLM needed
```

### 2. **Non-Verifiable (Subjective) Domains**
Problems where quality requires judgment and can't be objectively measured.

**Examples:**
- Email/customer support - "Did this answer the question well?"
- Content generation - "Is this title engaging?"
- Dialogue - "Was this response helpful?"
- Creative tasks - "Is this design appealing?"

**Reward Assignment:** LLM-as-judge (via RULER)
```python
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o4-mini")
# RULER ranks trajectories and assigns relative rewards
```

## Core RL Concepts

### **Environment**
The system that defines:
- **State representation** (e.g., `TwentyFortyEightGame` with board state)
- **Action space** (e.g., left/right/up/down moves)
- **Transition rules** (e.g., `condense_board()`, `populate_random_cell()`)
- **Terminal conditions** (e.g., `check_game_finished()`)

**Key insight:** Environments should be as simple as possible - complexity should be in the strategy, not the environment.

### **Rollout**
A single episode of agent interaction with environment.

**Process:**
1. Initialize environment state
2. Agent observes state, takes action
3. Environment transitions to new state
4. Repeat until terminal condition
5. Evaluate outcome and assign reward

```python
async def rollout(model, scenario) -> Trajectory:
    # Play one complete episode
    # Return trajectory with reward
```

### **Trajectory**
The complete record of one rollout episode.

**Contains:**
- `messages_and_choices`: All system/user/assistant messages
- `reward`: Single scalar reward for this episode
- `metadata`: Optional tracking info (game_id, step, etc.)
- `metrics`: Additional measurements (max_value, move_count, etc.)

```python
trajectory = art.Trajectory(
    messages_and_choices=[...],  # Conversation history
    reward=<calculated_value>,   # Success measure
    metadata={...},              # Tracking
)
```

## RULER: LLM-as-Judge for Trajectory Scoring

### How It Works

**Input: Unranked Trajectories**
```python
# Create trajectories with placeholder rewards
group = art.TrajectoryGroup([
    art.Trajectory(messages=[...], reward=0),  # Unscored
    art.Trajectory(messages=[...], reward=0),  # Unscored
    art.Trajectory(messages=[...], reward=0),  # Unscored
])
```

**Process: RULER Ranks & Scores**
```python
# RULER uses LLM judge to compare and rank all trajectories
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(
    group,             # Your unranked trajectories
    "openai/o4-mini",  # LLM judge model
    debug=True         # Optional: see judge's reasoning
)
```

**Output: Scored Trajectories**
```python
# Same trajectories, now with relative rewards assigned
judged_group.trajectories[0].reward  # e.g., 1.0 (best)
judged_group.trajectories[1].reward  # e.g., 0.5 (medium)
judged_group.trajectories[2].reward  # e.g., 0.0 (worst)
```

### Key Properties

**No Pre-Ranking Required:**
- You pass unranked trajectories
- RULER does all ranking via LLM judge
- No labeled data or expert rankings needed

**Relative Scoring:**
- Rewards are relative within the group, not absolute
- Only ranking matters: "A is better than B"
- Perfect fit for GRPO which needs group comparisons

**Efficient Judging:**
- One LLM call judges entire group (N trajectories)
- Much cheaper than N separate absolute scoring calls
- Works with smaller/cheaper judge models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-32B)

### Performance Optimizations

**1. Batch Judging (GRPO's Natural Fit)**
```python
# Instead of: judge each trajectory individually (N calls)
# RULER does: judge all N trajectories together (1 call)
```

**2. Smaller Judge Models Work**
- Don't need GPT-4/Claude for judging
- Qwen 2.5-32B works fine for relative comparisons
- "Which is better?" is easier than "Is this good?"

**3. Prompt Caching**
```
System: How to evaluate... [CACHED]
User: Task description... [CACHED]
User: Rank these N attempts [ONLY THIS CHANGES]
```

**4. Parallel Rollout Generation**
```python
# 18 agent rollouts run in parallel
# Then 1 judge call ranks them all
art.TrajectoryGroup(rollout(model, scenario) for _ in range(18))
```

**5. Judge Once Per Episode**
- 50-turn conversation = 50 agent calls + 1 judge call
- Not judging every single turn

### Cost Example (from Kyle's Talk)
- **Email Agent Training:** $80 total (including all LLM judge calls)
- **Result:** 96% accuracy vs 90% for o3
- **60% error reduction** - judge cost is negligible compared to value

## The Complete Training Flow

### Verifiable Domain (2048)
```python
# 1. Generate trajectories with deterministic rewards
for i in range(20):
    groups = [
        art.TrajectoryGroup(
            rollout(model, scenario) for _ in range(18)
        )
    ]
    
    # 2. Train directly (rewards already set in rollout)
    await model.train(groups, config=art.TrainConfig(...))
```

### Non-Verifiable Domain (Email Agent)
```python
# 1. Generate trajectories WITHOUT scores
group = art.TrajectoryGroup(
    rollout(model, scenario) for _ in range(18)
)

# 2. RULER judges and assigns rewards
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o4-mini")

# 3. Train with scored trajectories
await model.train([judged_group], config=art.TrainConfig(...))
```

---

## The Distinction That Matters

**Verifiable** → Environment provides ground truth → Fast, deterministic rewards → Direct training

**Non-Verifiable** → Need LLM judge → Adds latency but unlocks subjective domains → RULER + training

Both use the same core machinery (environments, rollouts, trajectories), just differ in **how the reward gets assigned**.

**GRPO's Key Insight:** Only need to know "which trajectory is better" within a group, not "how good is this trajectory" in absolute terms. This makes LLM judging practical and effective even with smaller models.

## Training Duration & Knowing When You're Done

### Verifiable vs Non-Verifiable: Different Stopping Criteria

| Type | Metric | Stop When | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Verifiable** | Accuracy % | Plateau + beat baseline (e.g., 96% vs 90%) | ART-E email Q&A |
| **Non-Verifiable** | Avg RULER reward | Reward plateau + manual quality checks | auto_rl.ipynb grammar |
| **Hybrid** | Both RULER reward + Validation accuracy | Validation accuracy plateau (primary) + reward plateau | Best of both worlds |

### Expected Timeline & Cost

**From ART-E (verifiable task):**
- ~1 week engineering time
- $80 GPU cost
- 100-200 training steps

**From auto_rl.ipynb (non-verifiable):**
- Few hours training time
- 25 inputs × 3 epochs × 2 groups/step ≈ 40 steps
- No accuracy metric exists - use RULER rewards + manual inspection

**RULER advantage:** Converges faster than hand-tuned rewards, allows partial credit.

### Training Curve Phases

1. **Initial Learning (0-40 steps):** Sharp improvement, learns basic tool use
2. **Gradual Refinement (40-100+):** Approaches/beats baseline
3. **Convergence:** Plateau - risk of reward hacking if continued

### Stop Training When:

**Verifiable domains:**
- ✅ Accuracy plateaus 10+ steps
- ✅ Beat baseline by meaningful margin
- ✅ Target threshold reached (e.g., 95%+)

**Non-verifiable domains:**
- ✅ Avg reward plateaus 10+ steps
- ✅ Manual inspection: outputs consistently good
- ✅ Human preference > baseline

**Both:**
- ✅ Secondary goals met (cost, latency, efficiency)
- ✅ No reward hacking in recent rollouts

### Reward Hacking: Critical Warning

**Watch for:**
- Sudden score jump after plateau
- Suspiciously perfect scores
- Weird/repetitive behavior

**Classic examples:**
- NYT Connections: Every word in every category
- Hacker News: "Google lays off 80%" for every article
- Boat race: Circling off-track for points

**Fix:** Adjust reward function to penalize exploit, then continue.

### Essential Monitoring

```python
# 1. Always inspect actual rollouts
for traj in sample_trajectories:
    print(traj.messages())  # What is it doing?

# 2. Track your metric
# Verifiable: accuracy vs baseline
# Non-verifiable: avg reward vs baseline

# 3. Watch for anomalies (sudden jumps = investigate)
```

> — Kyle Corbitt

**Key insight:** Reward functions are proxies, not truth. Models exploit gaps. 5 minutes of rollout inspection > hours debugging reward hacks.

## Hybrid Approach: RULER Training + Validation Stopping

### What It Is

When you have **50-500 labeled examples** (too few for supervised training), use:
1. **RULER for training rewards** - no labels needed, faster convergence
2. **Validation accuracy for stopping** - objective metric, automatic reward hacking detection

This is **not** verifiable domains - it's for subjective tasks with limited labeled data.

### Why It Works

**ART-E (OpenPipe's email agent):**
- Training: RULER judges trajectories (no ground truth)
- Validation: Accuracy checked every 5 steps (uses ground truth)
- Stopping: Validation accuracy plateaus at 96%
- Result: Beat o3 (90%) with 60% error reduction

**RULER paper results:**
- Reasoning Classifier: RULER (90%) > RLVR supervised (89%)
- Customer Support: RULER (93%) > hand-tuned with labels (92%)
- Converged **faster** than hand-tuned baselines

### Implementation Pattern

```python
# Split data (80/10/10)
training: 800 scenarios  # Labels hidden - RULER doesn't need them
validation: 100 scenarios  # Labels for stopping
test: 100 scenarios  # Final evaluation

# Training loop
for step in range(max_steps):
    # 1. RULER training (no ground truth)
    groups = [rollout(model, scenario) for scenario in batch]
    judged_groups = [await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o4-mini") 
                     for group in groups]
    await model.train(judged_groups)
    
    # 2. Validate every 5 steps (uses ground truth)
    if step % 5 == 0:
        val_accuracy = evaluate_on_validation_set(model, validation_set)
        
        # 3. Stop when validation plateaus
        if val_accuracy >= 95% and plateau_detected():
            break
```

### Key Benefits

**1. Efficient Label Use:** 50-200 examples enough (vs 10,000+ for supervised)

**2. Faster Convergence:** RULER gives partial credit vs binary hand-tuned rewards

**3. Objective Stopping:** Clear metric vs "does this look good?"

**4. Auto Reward Hacking Detection:** Val accuracy drops while reward increases? Stop immediately.

**5. Robust to Noisy Labels:** Labels only in validation, not training (RULER ignores them)

### When Metrics Diverge

| Observation | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Val ↑, Reward ↑ | ✅ Healthy | Continue |
| Val plateau, Reward ↑ | ⚠️ Converged | Stop soon |
| Val ↓, Reward ↑ | 🚨 **Reward hacking** | Stop & debug |

### Three Approaches Compared

| Approach | Labels | Training Reward | Stopping | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Verifiable** | 0 | Deterministic | Accuracy | Code, math, games |
| **Pure RULER** | 0 | LLM judge | Reward + inspection | No labels |
| **Hybrid** | 50-500 | LLM judge | **Val accuracy** | Most real tasks |
| **Supervised** | 10,000+ | Ground truth | Val loss | Abundant labels |

**Hybrid is the sweet spot for most production agent tasks.**

## Multi-Objective Reward Engineering

### Two Approaches Based on Domain

**Verifiable Domains (Code, Math, Games):**
```python
# Explicit weighted combination in rollout
trajectory.reward = (
    primary_objective * 1.0 +      # Correctness/winning
    secondary_objective * 0.2 +    # Efficiency/style
    penalty * -0.5                 # Avoid bad behaviors
)
```

**Example from 2048:**
```python
max_value_reward = log_scale(max_tile)       # Primary: high tile
board_value_reward = log_scale(total_value)  # Secondary: full board
trajectory.reward = max_value_reward + (board_value_reward * 0.2)
```

**Non-Verifiable Domains (Agents, Dialogue, Content):**
```python
# RULER handles everything via system prompt
system_prompt = """
PRIMARY: Answer questions correctly
SECONDARY: Be efficient (minimize searches)
TERTIARY: Say "I don't know" over guessing
"""

judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o4-mini")
# No manual reward engineering needed
```

### Key Insight: RULER Made Manual Rewards Obsolete

**ART-E Evolution:**

| Version | Approach | Accuracy | Convergence | Engineering |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **2024: Manual** | 8 hand-tuned reward components | 96% | Slower | ~1 week* |
| **2025: RULER** | Pure LLM judge + system prompt | 95% | **Faster** | Hours-2 days** |

*From Kyle's talk: "About a week of engineering time" for ART-E with manual rewards  
**From OpenPipe docs: "RULER can reduce implementation time by 2-3x" → hours to couple days vs days to weeks

**From RULER paper:**
> "Surprisingly, convergence was substantially **faster** on most RULER runs than with the hand-tuned baseline... because RULER was able to give partial rewards to answers that were close but incomplete."

### Guidelines

**1. Weight Scaling**
- Primary objective: 1.0 baseline
- Secondary objectives: 0.1-0.3 typical (observed in 2048 example: 0.2)*
- Penalties: Can be larger but watch for dominating

*Best practice: secondary should be "very small amount relative" to primary (Kyle's talk). General RL guidance: start with 10:1 ratio or higher, tune empirically for your task.

**2. For Verifiable Domains**
Use explicit weighted sums - you control exact behavior

**3. For Non-Verifiable Domains**
Use RULER with detailed system prompt - it automatically handles:
- Primary goals (correctness)
- Efficiency (mentioned in default rubric)
- Style preferences (from system prompt)
- Multiple objectives jointly

**4. RULER's Default Efficiency Handling**

From default rubric:
> "A trajectory that achieves its goal more efficiently (eg. by avoiding unproductive detours) should get a higher score than a trajectory that achieves its goal less efficiently."

**Don't manually add efficiency bonuses to RULER scores** - it already considers efficiency.

### The Trade-Off

**Manual rewards:** Full control, slightly higher accuracy, slow to design

**RULER:** Fast to deploy, 1-2% accuracy loss, faster convergence, no tuning

**Recommendation:** Use RULER unless you need that extra 1-2% and have time to iterate.
