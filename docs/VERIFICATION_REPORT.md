## CORRECTIONS MADE

### 1. auto_rl.ipynb Steps Calculation
- **Was:** "‚âà 40 steps"
- **Now:** "‚âà 38 steps" with math footnote
- **Reason:** (25/2) √ó 3 = 37.5, not 40

### 2. ART-E Training Steps
- **Was:** "100-200 training steps" stated as fact
- **Now:** "Training steps not explicitly stated (inferred...)" with clarifying footnote
- **Reason:** Not found in source documents

### 3. Stopping Criteria Table
- **Was:** ART-E listed under "Verifiable"
- **Now:** ART-E listed under "Hybrid" with footnote
- **Reason:** ART-E is non-verifiable (subjective) but uses hybrid approach

### 4. Weight Scaling Guidance
- **Was:** "0.1-0.3 (10-30% of primary)" without context
- **Now:** Clarified as observed in examples, with footnote about general RL best practice (10:1+)
- **Reason:** Perplexity research shows broader guidance
